## Step 1: Start the Web Application ✅

**What we just did:**
- Started the Next.js development server with `bun dev`
- The server should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`

**What to check:**
1. Open your browser
2. Go to: `http://localhost:3000`
3. You should see your Kabinda Lodge application

**If you see errors:**
- Check the terminal where `bun dev` is running
- Look for any error messages
- Share them with me and I'll help fix them

## Step 2: Verify Database Setup (Next)

Once the web app is running, we'll:
1. Check if all database tables exist
2. Verify the hotel record exists
3. Test the Agent Management page
